## Release Notes

### Version 1.0.0

This is the initial stable release of the Quantitative Derivatives Engine. It provides a comprehensive suite of option pricing models and risk management tools suitable for both academic research and practical financial applications.

**Key Features:**
- **Multiple Pricing Models**: Black-Scholes, Heston, and Merton jump-diffusion
- **Exact Greeks**: Automatic differentiation for precise sensitivity analysis
- **Exotic Options**: Comprehensive suite including barriers, Asian, and lookback options
- **High Performance**: Optimized for production-level speed and accuracy
- **Professional Quality**: Extensive testing, documentation, and CI/CD

**Target Audience:**
- Quantitative analysts and researchers
- Risk management professionals
- Financial software developers
- Academic institutions
- Trading firms and hedge funds

**Getting Started:**
```bash
pip install quantitative-derivatives-engine
```

See the README.md for detailed installation and usage instructions.

**Breaking Changes:**
None (initial release)

**Known Issues:**
- FFT pricing for Heston model may fail for extreme parameters
- Monte Carlo convergence depends on path count and random seed
- American option binomial tree limited to 10,000 steps for performance

**Future Roadmap:**
- American option Monte Carlo methods
- Stochastic interest rate models
- Credit derivatives pricing
- Multi-threading for large portfolios
- GUI interface for interactive analysis
